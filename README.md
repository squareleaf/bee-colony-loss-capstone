## Summary: 

Initial hypothesis: Causes of bee hive die-off between states are different enough that different disease prevention tactics should be determined by region or sub-region.

Conclusion: Using linear ridge regression and random forest regression with multiple combinations of independent variables as predictors demonstrates that region and sub-region data do not have significant predictive power in determining causes of colony loss. More robust data collection of colony stressors are required for future predictive models.
